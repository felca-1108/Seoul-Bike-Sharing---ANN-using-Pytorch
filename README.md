# Seoul-Bike-Sharing---ANN-using-Pytorch
The goal of this project is to predict the demand of bikes per hour in the Seoul Bike Sharing System using an Artificial Neural Network built with Pytorch.

Currently Rental bikes are introduced in many urban cities for the enhancement of mobility comfort. It is important to make the rental bike available and accessible to the public at the right time as it lessens the waiting time. Eventually, providing the city with a stable supply of rental bikes becomes a major concern. The crucial part is the prediction of bike count required at each hour for the stable supply of rental bikes.

In this project, we will predict the demand of bikes per hour in the Seoul Bike Sharing System. For this regression problem we are going to build an artificial neural network using Pytorch library.

The dataset is provided in the UCI Machine Learning Repository, in the link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/560/seoul+bike+sharing+demand .
